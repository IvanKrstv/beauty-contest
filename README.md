![2531_2-scaled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96f726f-bde4-4582-9008-e5b4ba3b3fd0)

This is a console program that handles an information system for a beauty contest, written in C++. It consists of a main menu, which operates with integer values, that are typed in the relevant place, in order to choose a function from it (don't worry, invalid inputs are handled properly ðŸ˜‰). Down below are all of the functions summarized in a few words. The whole documentation can be found [here](DocumentationBG.docx) but unfortunatelly, it is written in Bulgarian, as the whole project is a task from my university in Bulgaria.

## âš™ Options

### Loading information from text file
At first, after opening the program, it automatically loads information from a text file if it exists. Otherwise, a message is displayed that the file has not been found.
